Important info regarding modding GameFont
by Nightinggale

The exe has some hidden limitations regarding GameFont, particularly when it comes to city billboards.
More specifically ID assigning uses different code than what is used everywhere else. This can result in the GameFont debug output working while billboards doesn't.
This should not be a problem if the following restrictions are obeyed:
- do not add or remove boxes prior to vanilla symbols
- anything after vanilla symbols can't be used on billboards
- vanilla symbols aren't moved (IDs hardcoded in exe, at least the bullet char is)

GlobalDefineALT contains some GameFont offsets. This is to move IDs not used by billboards out of the billboard only range as well as moving custom symbols into the billboard range.

The exe assigns IDs during startup. Preventing it from doing so will crash the game. However we are free to change after the exe is done.
Changing GameFont IDs should be done in CvGlobals::setupGameFontChars(), which is called right after the exe is done doing whatever it is doing.

No known upper limit for GameFont icons as long as the icons aren't used on Billboards.
