<!-- Sets the contents of the language dropdown menu in the options menu. -->

<!-- When reading the individual TXT_KEYs, the game will read the tag mentioned here. -->
<!-- If not present, then English will be read instead, making incomplete translations playable. -->
<!-- Order doesn't matter. It's completely free which order the languages should appear in. -->

<!-- The names of the languages printed in the menu will be TXT_KEY_LANGUAGE_ + index, like TXT_KEY_LANGUAGE_0 -->
<!-- This means changing the order requires updating the TXT_KEY_LANGUAGE_ keys too. -->

<!-- Colonization stores the chosen language as the language, not the index from this file. -->
<!-- This means if you pick a language in one mod and loads another mod (using the same DLL), then
     the game will figure out using the same language even if they appear in different order. -->
<!-- If the language isn't present in the other mod, English will be used, though it won't update the settings. -->

<!-- Example: You pick German in mod A. Next you load mod B, which doesn't have a German translation.
     Mod B will appear in English. However if you don't change language in mod B, Mod A will still remember being in German. -->

<!-- Valid languages are listed in CvGameText::getLanguageName() in CvInfos.cpp -->

<!-- The "language" Tag can be used to display TXT_KEYs rather than text.
     Intended usage is when you find a string ingame you want to mod, but you don't know which key it is. -->
