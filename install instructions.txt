How do I install the mod ?

1) First make sure that your colonization game is patched to official patch 1.01f.
(Everything else will cause heavy problems.)

2) Like any other mod, copy this folder to your MODS folder.

Regarding mod name:
Multiplayer requires all players to call the mod the same thing.

Savegames can only be loaded using the same mod name as when they were saved. We can however change the mod name in a savegame.
